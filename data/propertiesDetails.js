        address: "Avenue Delcassé 35, Paris, France",
        description: "The old department store was originally conceived as an introverted building without openings to the outside. That principle had to be reversed: the interior daylight situation was a major challenge. The idea presented in the competition by FINLEY ARCHITECTS was to cut square-shaped prisms on each side of the building to flood the interior with natural light and by this, loosen up the massive monolithic geometry. These voids redefine the building's urban presence entirely, opening up the volume on all four sides. The basement floor and the entrance area continue the holistic image of the grid. The canopy above the basement is supported by inclined columns placed in accordance with the general design pattern. To illuminate the columns were chosen minimalistic lighting equipment with narrow optics and appropriate color temperature.",

        description: "Kennedy House is at its tender age, who is born in the Me Generation wherein its birth is intended for exploring the stronger relation between new-technology trends and aestheticism and Self-expressing. And Genhorn, in modern expression, would care to render any visit to the House into a journey of exploration of modernism and futurism. Combines the expertise of a global network and cross-practice collaboration from retail design, digital experience design to interior design and architecture disciplines, to leverage the power of design to create a better world. Nestled on a small peninsula with a lovely pool encompassing around, the House could be perceived as a vehicle-like gemstone mined out of a lake. Installed in 7,000 rectangular stainless steel plates, the façade unveils its true charm as the dusk falls — ribbons of LED underneath the metallic husk twinkle bright.",

        address: "374 Chengdu Road North, Shanghai, China",
        description: "The property is part of the new urban development project situated on riverine islands in the port of Shanghai. The two polder complexes East and West connected by a bridge for fire-brigade access lie on the south side of the quay. The polders ensure protection against flooding for the eight buildings planned. The office building on Zoning Plot 5 forms the western segment of the East Polder, a street connecting the port to the inner-city mainland. The separation of the two polder complexes causes a vacant lot to arise that simultaneously enables access to the waterside promenade. In addition, spacious outdoor stairways between the buildings equally permit access to the polder areas. This project resulted from an architectural competition for polder building development. The effect of light pollution is minimized because the luminous flux of the luminaires is aimed directly at the construction’s frame.",

        description: "The site is located at the intersection of two major axes: the city's established avenue of a commerce lined with financial offices and an organic pedestrian corridor linked to the City Hall Plaza and Galleria and lined with intimate cafes. Below ground, the site connects to a subway station and shopping concourse. The building program is predominantly workspace, within a given massing that is neither low-rise nor tower. Office buildings are often quite sober and withdrawn from public life. The introverted typology internalizes its atriums and lobbies, shrouding its best assets. Our approach was to excavate the facade on the corner of Meiji-dori and Inabacho-dori to articulate the convergence of two different urban activities. This gesture enhances two conditions simultaneously, they reveal the internal activity of the office and draw in public activity at the new entry plaza.",

        description: "Parabolically formed curved steel arches, resting on both banks, rise to a height of around 36m above the canal. The building is concieved as being a 'building within a building': a massive inner core offering more than 1200 workplaces within it's 32 000 sqare metres, housed within a glass skin, which encloses the comb-like form. Not only is the unusual construction visually impressive, but it also reduces energy consumption: the buffer zones between core and skin allow for natural ventilation within the office spaces, and contribute to the halving of the heating costs. Within the building, six glazed wintergardens contribute to the relaxation of the employees and provide space for exhibitions or parties. With it's unusual appearance, it's well considered spatial zones and it's modern energy concept, the building forms a strong gesture as a gateway connecting water and city.",

        description: "Generous, simple volumes of office buildings are seemingly placed randomly on the plot. In fact, the final solution was preceded by countless variants of calculations of areas and angles, distribution and size of individual masses, and examination of their interrelationships. The result is a carefully constructed geometry of three equal volumes, and the free space between them. The architectural solution refers to the original industrial character of the site and its genius loci. Large masses, seven-storey office buildings, equipped with state-of-the-art technology, they are “machines” for work. Industrial brick facades in black and brown, slim tall windows with distinctive shutters and external blinds. On the ground floor of the shopping area, there are cafes and restaurants, and also a generous entrance lobby with a distinctive canopy.",
